\begin{itemize}
\item Determine if the linear matching templates problem is \NP-complete.
\item Determine the complexity of other variants of the linear matching
  templates problem, including the one in which there is a partial order
  restriction on overlapping colors.
\item Consider the effect of probabilistically introduced wild-card tiles.
