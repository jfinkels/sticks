Consider a linear tile with three cells. Each cell contains one color. Two
tiles can overlap wherever the cells have the same color. Given a set of tiles,
we wish to compute the linear layout of (possibly overlapping) tiles with the
shortest total length. Formally, the linear matching templates (LMT) problem
can be defined as follows:

\colorlet{shadecolor}{blue!40!gray!20}
\begin{shaded}
\begin{definition}\mbox{}

  Instance: a finite set of colors $\Sigma$, a finite set of sticks
  $T\subseteq\Sigma^3$, and $k\in\mathbb{N}$

  Question: Does there exist a layout $c\colon\{1,\ldots,k\}\to\Sigma$ such
  that for all tiles $(x, y, z)\in T$, there exists a position
  $n\in\{1,\ldots,k-2\}$ such that $c(n)=x$, $c(n+1)=y$ and $c(n+2)=z$?
\end{definition}
\end{shaded}
