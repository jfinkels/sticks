\section{Motivation}

How does the human mind create and understand sentences in natural language?

How long would it take for a computer to use the same strategies?

\section{Problem definition}

Consider a linear tile with three cells. Each cell contains one color. Two
tiles can overlap wherever the cells have the same color. Given a set of tiles,
we wish to compute the linear layout of (possibly overlapping) tiles with the
shortest total length. Formally,

\begin{shaded}
\begin{definition}\mbox{}\\
  Instance: a finite set of symbols $\Sigma$, a finite set of sticks
  $T\subseteq\Sigma^3$, and $k\in\mathbb{N}$

  Question: Does there exist a layout $c\colon\{1,\ldots,k\}\to\Sigma$ such
  that for all tiles $(x, y, z)\in T$, there exists a position
  $n\in\{1,\ldots,k-2\}$ such that $c(n)=x$, $c(n+1)=y$ and $c(n+2)=z$?
\end{definition}
\end{shaded}

\section{Complexity}

The linear matching system problem is in \NP. So far we can neither prove that
it is \NP-complete nor that it is in \P.

\section{NP-complete variants}

The following variants of the linear matching system problem are
\NP-complete.

{\bf Linear matching system with intersecting sets}. If we allow each tile to
have a set of colors and allow tiles to overlap if the intersection of the
overlapping sets is non-empty, then the problem is \NP-complete.

\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
  The reduction is from $\lang{HAMPATH} = \{G=(V, E)|G$ is a graph with a
  Hamiltonian path$\}$. Transform each vertex of the graph into a tile, where
  the middle cell is the vertex, the left cell is the set of all incoming
  edges, and the right cell is the set of all outgoing edges. Then there is a
  layout of length $3|V| - (|V| - 1) = 2|V| + 1$ if and only if there is a
  Hamiltonian path in $G$.
\end{proof}

{\bf Linear matching system chosen from bins}. If we are given a set of bins
containing tiles and require that one must be chosen from each bin, then the
problem is \NP-complete.

\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
  The reduction is again from $\lang{HAMPATH}$. For each vertex, create one bin
  and place in it one tile for each pair of incoming and outgoing edge, so that
  the left cell of the tile is one incoming edge, the middle cell is the
  vertex, and the right cell is one outgoing edge. Then there is a layout of
  length $2|V| + 1$ with one cell chosen from each bin if and only if there is
  a Hamiltonian path in $G$.
\end{proof}

\section{Linear programming characterization}

We can characterize these problems as integer linear programming problems so
that we may use the techniques and optimizations of general integer linear
programming solvers to decide these problems.

\begin{shaded}
\begin{definition}[Linear programming characterization]
  Let $C$ be a finite set of colors, let $k\in\mathbb{N}$ be the maximum
  length of the layout, let $n\in\mathbb{N}$ be the number of tiles, and let
  $s_{i,j}\in C$ be the symbol on tile $i$ at position $j$, where $1\leq i\leq
  n$ and $0\leq j\leq 2$. (We will assume for simplicity that $C$ is just the
  set $\{1, 2,\ldots, |C|\}$.)

  Let variable $x_{i,j}\in\{0, 1\}$, where $1\leq i\leq k$ and $1\leq j\leq
  |C|$, be defined by $x_{i, j} = 1$ if and only if symbol $j$ is at position
  $i$. Let variable $y_{i,j}\in\{0, 1\}$, where $1\leq i\leq k-2$ and $1\leq
  j\leq n$, be defined by $y_{i, j} = 1$ if and only if tile $j$ starts at
  position $i$.
    
  Let the constraints be as follows.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item[$\cdot$] Every tile must start at exactly one position:
    \begin{displaymath}
      \sum_{i = 1}^{k - 2}{y_{i, j}} = 1,\,\textnormal{for}\, 1\leq j\leq n
    \end{displaymath}
  \item[$\cdot$] Each position in the layout must have at most one symbol:
    \begin{displaymath}
      \sum_{j = 1}^{|C|}{x_{i, j}} = 1,\,\textnormal{for}\, 1\leq i\leq k
    \end{displaymath}
  \item[$\cdot$] The symbols of the layout must correspond to the symbols of
    the tiles:
    \begin{displaymath}
      y_{i, j} \leq x_{i + m, s_{j, m}}
    \end{displaymath}
    for $1\leq i\leq k - 2$, $1\leq j\leq n$, $0\leq m\leq 2$.
  \end{itemize}
    
  The linear matching system problem is the problem of determining feasibility
  of the above linear programming instance.
\end{definition}
\end{shaded}
