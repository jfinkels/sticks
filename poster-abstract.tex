In this poster we consider the computational complexity of the ``linear
matching systems'' problem: given a set of tiles, each with three colored
cells, what is the shortest linear layout of the tiles, allowing overlaps where
tiles have matching colors? This problem is motivated by the study of natural
language, specifically the way sentences are composed from words using
relationships between each word and its possible neighbors. Though we have not
yet proven the exact complexity of the linear matching systems problem, we can
show the NP-completeness of certain variants. We also provide the
characterization of the problem and some variants as linear programming
problems for use by general linear programming solvers.
