We can characterize these problems as integer linear programming problems so
that we may use the techniques and optimizations of general integer linear
programming solvers to decide these problems.

\begin{definition}[Linear programming characterization]
  Let $C$ be a finite set of colors, let $k\in\mathbb{N}$ be the maximum
  length of the layout, let $n\in\mathbb{N}$ be the number of tiles, and let
  $s_{i,j}\in C$ be the symbol on tile $i$ at position $j$, where $1\leq i\leq
  n$ and $0\leq j\leq 2$. (We will assume for simplicity that $C$ is just the
  set $\{1, 2,\ldots, |C|\}$.)

  Let variable $x_{i,j}\in\{0, 1\}$, where $1\leq i\leq k$ and $1\leq j\leq
  |C|$, be defined by $x_{i, j} = 1$ if and only if symbol $j$ is at position
  $i$. Let variable $y_{i,j}\in\{0, 1\}$, where $1\leq i\leq k-2$ and $1\leq
  j\leq n$, be defined by $y_{i, j} = 1$ if and only if tile $j$ starts at
  position $i$.
    
  Let the constraints be as follows.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item[$\cdot$] Every tile must start at exactly one position:
    \begin{displaymath}
      \sum_{i = 1}^{k - 2}{y_{i, j}} = 1,\,\textnormal{for}\, 1\leq j\leq n
    \end{displaymath}
  \item[$\cdot$] Each position in the layout must have at most one symbol:
    \begin{displaymath}
      \sum_{j = 1}^{|C|}{x_{i, j}} = 1,\,\textnormal{for}\, 1\leq i\leq k
    \end{displaymath}
  \item[$\cdot$] The symbols of the layout must correspond to the symbols of
    the tiles:
    \begin{displaymath}
      y_{i, j} \leq x_{i + m, s_{j, m}}
    \end{displaymath}
    for $1\leq i\leq k - 2$, $1\leq j\leq n$, $0\leq m\leq 2$.
  \end{itemize}
    
  The linear matching templates problem is the problem of determining
  feasibility of the above linear programming instance.
