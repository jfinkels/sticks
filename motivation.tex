One of the goals of the study of syntax in natural languages is to explore how
the human mind understands sentential structure. For example, modern syntax
research suggests that the passive sentence

\begin{quote}
  \emph{The fries were eaten by John.}
\end{quote}

is less related to the corresponding active sentence

\begin{quote}
  \emph{John eats the fries}
\end{quote}

than to

\begin{quote}
  \emph{The children were happy in Paris.}
\end{quote}

Here, the past participle ``eaten'' yields the complex verb ``is eaten'' which
allows a ``by'' phrase. In this way, the passive sentence is more similar to a
sentence containing a predicate adjective.

We wish to determine how difficult it is for a computer to perform a matching
of word templates like the one in the above example.
